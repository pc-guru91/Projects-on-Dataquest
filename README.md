This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that we work on the guided projects from [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io).

Here are the project's notebooks and short decriptions of what we learn and practice:

- [Using Jupyter Notebook: ](https://github.com/quangddt/Projects-on-Dataquest/blob/master/Using_Jupyter_Notebook/Using_Jupyter.ipynb)Learn how to perform analysis and communicate results with Jupyter notebook
- [Exploring Gun Deaths in the US: ](https://github.com/quangddt/Projects-on-Dataquest/blob/master/Exploring_Gun_Deaths_in_the_US/Exploring_Gun_Deaths.ipynb)Use list comprehensions, modules, and the datetime package to find patterns in US gun death data.
- [Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors: ](https://github.com/quangddt/Projects-on-Dataquest/blob/master/Visualizing_Earning_Based_On_College_Majors/Visualzing_Earnings.ipynb)Learn how to use pandas to quickly create visualizations.
